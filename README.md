### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jani
#### I am an IT-student interested in UI/UX and Full-Stack.
I'm 30-something guy from Finland, with a previous BBA in International Business (specialized in Marketing and CRM), with a passion towards all things tech. I'm especially interested in UI/UX, Web/App development and Cloud Infrastructure.

I have a long history in retail and currently work as an Operations Specialist in a tech retail store in Finland, alongside my studies.

On my free time I enjoy photography, outdoors, travelling and spending time with my family & friends. We recently got a Norwich Terrier puppy that keeps us busy with her lively personality.
